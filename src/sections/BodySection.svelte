  <h1>Financial Well-Being</h1>
  <p>First, let’s take a look at what is financial well-being.</p>

  <p>
    According to the <a
      href="https://hr.umich.edu/benefits-wellness/health-well-being/mhealthy/faculty-staff-well-being/financial-well-being"
      >University of Michigan Human Resources</a

  <p>
    “Being financially well means you can meet your current and ongoing
    financial obligations, feel secure in your financial future, and are able to
    make choices that allow you to enjoy life – in other words, financial
    freedom.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Factors that can contribute to or detract from financial well-being include
    employment, income and expenses, banking and credit, assets and debts,
    housing costs, higher education, loans, investments, etc.
  </p>

  <p>
    Despite the plethora of data showing the financial disparities and distance
    between the Black population and other wealthier racial groups, I
    surprisingly found some data showing some improvements for the Black
    population in the following areas: Assets and Debts, Education, Employment,
    and Business.

  <h3>1. Median Total Net Worth for Black Households increased</h3>

  <p>
    From 2019 to 2022, Black households’ <strong>median total net worth</strong>
    jumped from $28,000 to $44,000.

  <p>
    According to the explanation that appears in this data graphic when you
    hover your cursor over the vertical dotted line above 2020, in the years
    following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, factors such as <strong
      >wage growth</strong
    >, <strong>government support</strong> (such as <strong>stimulus checks</strong>), and
    <strong>rising home values</strong>
    contributed to Americans’ wealth.
  </p>

  <p>
    Most notably, “Black households experienced the <strong
      >biggest percentage increase</strong> as <strong>median net worth rose 59 percent</strong> to $44,100.”
